# Use Comparison operator to find out whether a variable a is greater than b or not.
# take a = 45 and b = 80

# a = 45
# b = 80
# ans = a > b
# print(ans)



# write a python program to find average of two numbers entered by the user

# number1 = input("Enter first number : ")
# number2 = input("Enter Second number : ")

# number1 = int(number1)
# number2 = int(number2)

# avg = (number1 + number2)/2
# print (avg)


# write a python program to calculate square of a number entered by the user

# number = input("Enter your number : ")

# number = int(number)

# ans = number * number
